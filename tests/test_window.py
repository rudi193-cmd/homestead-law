"""Bite 4 of docs/PLAN-first-runnable.md — the two S1 surfaces, list and detail.

The first thing in the package that *renders*. `Window` is the surface, and it is
deliberately display-agnostic: it holds the state (cover / list / detail) and the
rows or the served datum for the current state, and a view (tkinter, in
`view.py`) draws them. That split is I-29 — *the surface layer holds no domain
logic* — taken literally: `Window` composes through `serve` and calculates
nothing, so there is no rung arithmetic in it to drift from the gate.
law-gazelle's 1,296-line `app.py` is what the other choice looks like.

Two invariants meet here:

* **I-21 — no auto-render on start.** A fresh `Window` rests on the cover and
  shows no record. The queue is not drawn before a human asks; an app that
  renders on mount has shipped F-5 once.
* **the crossing — the list cannot carry what the detail can.** The list is
  `S1_LIST`, ceiling `L3`: it shows `L1`-`L3` payloads, the *derived* form for
  `L4`, and nothing at all for `L5`. The detail is `S1_DETAIL`, ceiling `L4`, and
  opening it is the purpose declaration — so it may show the `L4` payload.
  Neither ever shows an `L5`.

A `Row` carries a **reference** (the record's key), never a payload — so the list
is interactive (a click opens an item by ref) without a datum ever living on the
surface. `Window` reaches no `.payload`; the chokepoint
(`test_invariants_chokepoint.py`) makes that a build failure.
