"""X7-drift-law — the meta-scan: every AST/grep-guard helper this suite
carries has been shown to catch something, by a test that *calls it*.

*A scan that has never fired has not been shown to check anything* is the
repo's own rule (`tests/test_i44_no_drafting.py`'s own docstring cites it,
and every `_offenders`/`_reaches`/`_hits` helper here follows it). This file
is that rule turned into a test that reads the *other* test files: it finds
every module-level helper in ``tests/`` that is shaped like a
violation-scanner and asserts that some planted-violation test in the *same
file* runs that helper — directly, or through another helper it calls.
Ported from `homestead-health`'s own `tests/test_scans_fire.py` (X7-drift-
health), which settled the discovery rule below after its own audit found
two scans the first cut of this file could not see; adopted here rather than
reinvented, per the same "one definition, not two that can drift apart"
reasoning `tests/_strikethrough.py`'s docstring gives.

**Discovery is structural, not a naming convention.** A first cut of this
kind of file looked for helpers whose *name* carried one of the repo's own
stems (`_payload_reaches`, `_banned_phrase_hits`) or required a leading
underscore. Both restrictions missed real scans: a public
`check_payload_reach(...)` that walks `ast` (missed on the underscore rule —
and its name carries `check`, which no stem list held either), and a
grep-shaped `forbidden_word_hits(path)` that reads a file and asks
`"payload" in text` with no `ast` and no matching stem at all. So the rule
below is what a scan *does*:

* it parses or walks source (`ast.parse`, `ast.walk`), **or**
* it matches text with a pattern (`re.search`/`findall`/`finditer`/`match`/
  `fullmatch`/`compile`, or a module-level compiled pattern's `.search(…)`),
  **or**
* it reads a file's text (`.read_text()`/`.read_bytes()`) *and* asks a
  membership question of it (`x in text`, `x not in parts`) — the grep shape
  with no regex in it, which `tests/test_docs_drift.py::_contains` is.

The name stems and the `_is_` prefix are kept on top of that, not instead of
it: they still catch helpers that hand their work to a caller without
themselves matching a pattern. Discovery is a union, so it is strictly wider
than the convention it replaced, never narrower.

**Having a plant means a plant test calls the scan.** A cut that reads names
and docstrings only lets a test called `test_the_guard_fires` that never
touches the guard clear the whole file. A helper counts as planted only when
a `test_*` function whose name or docstring carries `plant`, `fires` or
`catches` reaches it — through the module's own helpers as well as directly,
so a plant that calls a wrapper has exercised the helper underneath it too.

**Honest about what it still cannot see.** A helper that reaches `ast.parse`
through an alias (`from ast import parse as p`), one that shells out to
`grep`, or one whose whole check is a comparison of two already-read strings
with no membership test and no pattern, is outside the rule above. Closing
those needs an interpreter, not a reader; this scan is the AST-grep half, not
a promise that it sees everything a scan could be shaped like. Scans written
inline in a test body rather than as a helper are invisible to it too.
