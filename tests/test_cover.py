"""I-31 — the resting state reveals nothing (`homestead.app.cover`).

Promoted from `test_invariants_pending.py` when the cover's counts were built as
the Phase-4 re-identification check. The pinned test moved here unmarked — the
fourth occasion of this promotion (dates, surfaces, record, then this) —
`test_pending_liveness` failed the moment `homestead.app.cover` existed and would
not go green again until it was moved and `"homestead.app.cover"` struck from
`UNBUILT`.

`cover_counts(matters, **counts)` returns only the per-category counts that
survive the `L2` re-identification check: a count survives when it clears both
anonymity gates (`K = 2` matters *and* `K = 2` in the count itself), and is
otherwise absent. See `homestead/app/cover.py` and
`docs/DECISION-cover-re-identification.md`.

The one test the pending file pinned is `test_i31_the_cover_survives_re_identification`.
Everything else here is a hard case the pin does not reach — the two gates fired
independently, absence-not-zero, and the survivor rendered as its real number.
