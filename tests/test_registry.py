"""I-23 — the registry is the only enumeration.

Promoted out of `test_invariants_pending.py` when `homestead.keep.registry`
landed, which is what `test_pending_liveness` is for: the moment the module
existed the pending file failed by name, and would not go green again until the
Phase 3 test was promoted out, unmarked. This is the fourth occasion of that
same promotion — dates, surfaces, record, now the registry — and it went
through the same door: the `"homestead.keep.registry"` key comes out of
`UNBUILT`, and the pending `test_i23…` moves here with its body and docstring
kept.

BUG-6 is the failure this whole file exists against. The predecessor advertised
three matter types and enumerated them by hand in three places — navigation, the
urgent queue, the briefing. The lists drifted, workers' comp fell out of the
queue's copy, and a deadline in a workers'-comp matter could not become urgent
because the loop that raised urgency never iterated that type. Every test that
asked "are all matters handled?" asked its own hand-kept list, so none caught
it. The answer is one enumeration — `all_matters()` over `REGISTRY` — and a
structural guard that a matter which exists but is not registered stops the
build rather than going silently unhandled.
