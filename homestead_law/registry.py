"""The matter-type registry — the one enumeration of what a household handles.

I-23: **the registry is the only enumeration.** Anything that touches "all
matters" iterates this, and nothing keeps a matter list of its own. That is not
tidiness; it is the direct answer to BUG-6.

## BUG-6, which is why this file exists

The predecessor advertised three matter types and enumerated them by hand in
three separate places — navigation, the urgent queue, and the briefing. The
three lists drifted, and workers' comp — one of the three — was structurally
absent from the urgent queue: not filtered out, not deprioritised, *never
iterated*. A deadline in a workers'-comp matter could not become urgent because
the loop that raised urgency did not know the matter type existed. No test
caught it, because every test that asked "are all matters handled?" asked its
own hand-kept list the same wrong question.

A single enumeration cannot drift from itself. `all_matters()` is that
enumeration, `REGISTRY` is what it iterates, and the guard below makes a matter
that exists but is not registered — BUG-6's exact shape, a real type missing
from the list a loop trusts — a build failure rather than a silent gap.

## What a registry entry is, and what it is not

Keyed by matter name, valued by a `MatterType` that ties the name to its
**pack** — the closed schema module (`homestead_law.packs.custody`) that authored
and classified the fields. The registry holds a *reference* to the pack, not a
copy of it: `fields` and `schema` read `pack.FIELDS`/`pack.SCHEMA` live, so
there is exactly one field list in the process and the registry cannot drift
from the pack the way three hand-kept lists drifted from each other. The host
imports the pack; the pack never imports the host (Article IV's injected-seam
shape, and the reason this file depends on `packs` and not the reverse).

This is `surfaces.FACTS` in a second place: an authored table, keyed by a
member, cross-checked at import against the set of members that actually exist,
so one added and forgotten stops the build instead of failing open on the day
something iterates it. The value shape is a frozen dataclass rather than the
raw module for the same reason `SurfaceFacts` is one — a consumer reads a small
closed contract (`name`, `jurisdiction`, `jurisdictions`, `fields`, `schema`)
instead of rummaging a module's namespace for whatever it happens to expose.
`jurisdiction` is the default a new instance of the matter starts under and
`jurisdictions` is every jurisdiction it may be filed in (decision 1); the
guard below holds the first inside the second.

## Only custody is built

Custody is the one pack in v1 — *"one pack proves the seam; three prove nothing
that one does not."* Bankruptcy and workers' comp are the two other types the
model discusses (a case number is `L1` in a bankruptcy, `L3` in a family
matter), and they are **Phase 5, not built**. They are not in this registry,
and inventing a stub for either would be the hand-kept phantom this invariant
forbids — a matter name in a list with no pack behind it, which is the missing
half of BUG-6.

## What it does not hold

* **No rung logic.** A matter's rungs live in its pack, classified at import by
  `rungs.classify_schema`. The registry reads them; it does not set them.
* **No store, no gate.** This file deals in matter *names* and *schemas*, never
  in record content — it never reaches a `.payload`
  (`tests/test_invariants_chokepoint.py` enforces that it cannot).
